week 6 assignment for Giphy API

This application allows the user to search the Giphy database via button-click for a pre-loaded set of Marvel superheroes, or to add their own superhero search button and search.

The app returns a set of 50, but only displays the first 10 until the user repeats the search. Other features: 
- Users can toggle the animation on or off via click;
- Users can select and then display favorites in a separate window;
- Users can remove individual favorites or clear the entire set.

Future versions of the app will allow the user to toggle on/off the animation within the saved favorites, and keep them in local storage for future sessions.
